# CORDIC-Based Phase Correction on FPGA
This project implements the CORDIC (COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer) algorithm for signal phase rotation and correction in a digital communication system using 32-PSK (Phase Shift Keying).

The work was developed as a final project for EL2002 â€“ Digital Systems (Institut Teknologi Bandung, 2024). The system is designed in VHDL and implemented on an FPGA, with UART communication support and Python Serial Tool integration for input/output handling.

**ðŸ”§ Key Features**

CORDIC implementation for calculating and correcting signal phase.

32 reference angles (32PSK) for precise phase correction.

Input coordinates (x, y) via UART in HEX format â†’ processed â†’ converted into degrees/radians.

Modular VHDL design with reusable blocks:

register16bit, addsub, multiplier24to16bit, mux, counter4bit, etc.

Integration with Python for data conversion and visualization.

**ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure**

src/ â†’ VHDL source code (main modules and submodules).

sim/ â†’ Simulation files and testbenches (ModelSim).

docs/ â†’ Technical report and documentation.

python/ â†’ Python scripts for UART communication and output processing.

**ðŸš€ Workflow Overview**

Input coordinates (x,y) are sent from PC â†’ FPGA via UART.

FPGA executes the CORDIC iterative rotation algorithm.

Output phase is computed in binary, radians, and degrees.

Results are sent back to PC for display/processing.
